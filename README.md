# MyReads Project

### A Book Lending App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. The command I used to create the app : npx create-react-app "App name"

This is a basic bank app created with Create React App
To start, After cloning the repo, with "git clone https://github.com/David-Kuku/Udacity-React-NanoDegree_First_Project.git", run

npm install
This installs all the package I used in building the app which will be needed to run the app.

Then, run

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Once the app opens in the browser,

A main page is shown that displays all the books currently in a shelf; could be "currentlyReading", "Want to read" or "read" shelf
By clicking on the drop down on each book, a user can change the shelf to which the book belong to.

A plus (+) is displayed at the bottom, onclick of this, a user is directed to the search page where 
a book can be searched for using the title or the author. 
When the search is made, books matching the search query are displayed. On clicking the dropdown button on each book,one can see
whether a book belongs to a shelf on the main page already, one can also change the book's shelf and this will reflect on the main page.
